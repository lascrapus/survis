abstract = {Real-time monitoring of road traffic variables is essential for any effective control strategy in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Network-wide monitoring has increased importance in the current and future panorama due to the verge of adoption of smart mobility technologies, i.e. monitoring all links in a network is a general desired goal. However, installation and maintenance of sensors across the whole network are not cost-effective. Therefore, traffic networks are frequently suffering from the lack of well-operating and reliable traffic detectors. The paper proposes the employment of neural networks based models to virtualize the measurements on road links without detectors. The proposed method applies the measurements of monitored links as input to the deep learning model in order to estimate virtual measurements on the unmonitored road links. Several neural network models differing in architecture (Artificial Neural Network, Time Lagged Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Neural Network) have been implemented and their hyper-parameterization were optimized using Bayesian search. The prediction techniques were developed and tested by using microscopic road traffic simulation.},

abstract = {With the advent of the data-driven era, deep learning approaches have been gradually introduced to short-term traffic flow prediction, which plays a vital role in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). A hybrid predicting model based on deep learning is proposed in this paper, including three steps. Firstly, an improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method is applied to decompose the nonlinear time series of highway traffic flow to obtain the intrinsic mode function (IMF). The fuzzy entropy (FE) is then calculated to recombine subsequences, highlighting traffic flow dynamics in different frequencies and improving prediction efficiency. Finally, the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is adopted to predict the recombined subsequences, and the final prediction result is reconstructed. Two sensors of US101-S on the main road and on-ramp were selected to measure the prediction effect. The results show that the prediction error of the proposed model on two sensors is notably decreased on single-step and multistep prediction, compared with the original TCN model. Furthermore, the proposed improved CEEMDAN-FE-X framework can be combined with prevailing prediction methods to increase the prediction accuracy, among which the improved CEEMDAN-FE-TCN model has the best performance and strong robustness.},

abstract = {The accurate and effective prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles plays a significant role in the construction and planning of signalized road intersections. The application of artificially intelligent predictive models in the prediction of the performance of traffic flow has yielded positive results. However, much uncertainty still exists in the determination of which artificial intelligence methods effectively resolve traffic congestion issues, especially from the perspective of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. A hybrid algorithm, an artificial neural network trained by a particle swarm optimization model (ANN-PSO), and a heuristic Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) were compared in the prediction of the flow of traffic of vehicles using the South Africa transportation system as a case study. Two hundred and fifty-nine (259) traffic datasets were obtained from the South African road network using inductive loop detectors, video cameras, and GPS-controlled equipment. For the ANN and ANN-PSO training and testing, 219 traffic data were used for the training, and 40 were used for the testing of the ANN-PSO model, while training (160), testing (40), and validation (59) was used for the ANN. The ANN result presented a logistic sigmoid transfer function with a 13–6–1 model and a testing R2 of 0.99169 compared to the ANN-PSO result, which showed a testing performance of R2 0.99710. This result shows that the ANN-PSO model is more efficient and effective than the ANN model in the prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. Furthermore, the ANN and ANN-PSO models are robust enough to predict traffic flow due to their better testing performance. The modelling approaches proposed in this study will assist transportation engineers and urban planners in designing a traffic control system for traffic lights at four-way signalized road intersections. Finally, the results of this research will assist transportation engineers and traffic controllers in providing traffic flow information and travel guidance for motorists and pedestrians in the optimization of their travel time decision-making.},
